### Interactive Code Block

Below is a sample interactive code block with some initial code provided.

```{webr-r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = class, y = cty, fill = class)) + 
  labs(
    title = "City Gas Mileage by Vehicle Class",
    x = "",
    y = "City Gas Mileage (mpg)"
  ) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "None")
```

Here's another code chunk, but it is empty to start.

```{webr-r}



```

That's all there is to building a `WebR` document.
